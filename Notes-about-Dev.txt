In order to build the DLL file (aka the mod), you need the following components:

1. A Build System
    e.g. CMake
    Role: Take your CMakeLists.txt and generates build instructions.
    Analogy: Like a foreman coordinating a construction crew.

2. A Generator
    e.g. Ninja
    Role: Tells CMake how to generate the build instructions.
    Analogy: Like a blueprint that tells the foreman where to allocate the construction crew.

3. A Compiler
    e.g. MSVC
    Role: Takes the source code (.cpp) and compiles it into machine code (.obj) and links them into DLL files.
    Analogy: Like the construction crew that builds the house.
    How to set up:
        1. Download the MS C++ Build Tools (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
        2. In order to use these Tools, you must build by opening the "x64_x86 Cross Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022".
            - Note: sometimes it helps by running this as Admin in case of access restrictions while building.

4. Optionally, a Package Manager
    e.g. vcpkg
    Role: Downloads and integrates third-party libraries and dependencies.
    Analogy: Like a warehouse that provides the construction crew with the necessary materials.
